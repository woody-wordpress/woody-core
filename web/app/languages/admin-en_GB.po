#. currently supported by PHP. Important: When a previous timezone string, like
#. `Europe/Kiev`, has been superseded by an updated one, like `Europe/Kyiv`, as
#. a rule of thumb, the **old** timezone name should be used in the
#. "translation" to allow for the default timezone setting to be PHP
#. cross-version compatible, as old timezone names will be recognized in new
#. PHP versions, while new timezone names cannot be recognized in old PHP
#. versions. To verify which timezone strings are available in the _oldest_ PHP
#. version supported, you can use https://3v4l.org/6YQAt#v5.6.20 and replace
